# Target Test

The result of me following Challacade's LÃ¶ve2D game engine tutorial, but using the MoonScript programming language rather than Lua. I also added additional stuff for efficiency, such as a check to ensure that the circle doesn't spawn partially out of bounds.

Basically, you click the circle to get points, after which it reappears elsewhere at a random location.
